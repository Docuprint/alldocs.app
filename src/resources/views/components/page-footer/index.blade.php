      Alldocs â€” The text converter for all your documents
    </h3>
    <p>
      This is a super fancy text converter. Wow. Amaze.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Free
    </h4>
    <p>
      We thought about making a VERY expensive app with offline support later, but weâ€™re lazy.
    </p>
    <h4>
      No Ads
    </h4>
    <p>
      We forgot to install ads. Good for you, there is no real tracking here. Sorry, Google.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Secure
    </h4>
    <p>
      After 12 hours your files are deleted from our server. We donâ€™t have time to read them anyway.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Open Startup
    </h4>
    <p>
      We made a public dashboard that has all our numbers. Even the revenue, but surprisingly itâ€™s $0.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Just Works
    </h4>
    <p>
      Upload a file & download the converted file. Like a good joke, it needs no further explanation.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Cool Design
    </h4>
    <p>
      We checked out every post on Dribbble, took the best out and here it is: The perfect design.
