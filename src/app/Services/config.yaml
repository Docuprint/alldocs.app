    description: AsciiDoc is like the older brother of Markdown. It’s human-readable without any special tools. It’s like DocBook XML, but based on plain-text mark-up (instead of XML). Add an = in front of a line to mark it as headline. It’s easy like that. Wondering who uses this text format? Wikipedia states that the Git documentation is written in AsciiDoc. I’m not Wikipedia or near as clever, but you landed here and chances are high that you are in the club of people using AsciiDoc. Or maybe you just have to use this format. No matter what, just upload the file and convert it to any other format. Hope it helps!

    description: "Markdown was developed in 2004, with a spec and an implementation in Perl. Over the years implementations for more and more programming languages evolved. Unfortunately the specification was ambiguous in some points, so some implementations did things differently. CommonMark was developed 10 years later, in 2014, with an unambiguous spec and tests to see if new implementations are correct according to the spec. A few big players (GitHub, GitLab, Reddit, Swift and many more) adopted this common standard. So it’s basically the standard you might know already.

Many systems offer it as an option, but only few use it by default. And why should they? They can come here and convert any text format in any other text format for free anyway.

Normally this is the part where I say something bad about the file format, but to be honest, I really like DocBook. Oh, just one thing: It’s very old.

And the best thing: It’s DRM-free. In contrast to ePub it’s a single XML file, even images are embedded (as Base64). That’s how e-books should work I guess.

It started as a writing tool for mathematicians and computer scientists, but has quickly been taken up by scholars who wanted to write documents with math expressions or non-Latin scripts (Arabic or Chinese for example). As with a lot of other text document formats, it’s used to structure the content, not style it. LaTeX is used directly or as an intermediate format to produce files for printing or digital distribution. It supports highlighting (such as bold or italic), citations and cross-references. Or to make it short: It’s the most powerful format to structure your texts. Convert all your files to LaTeX."

You can open the XML file in the program of your liking, update the content and re-open it in your office program without worrying to break the file.
