    description: We love Markdown, it's just text. It's so simple and so powerful at the same time. Pure beauty. It's this one standard that works everywhere. Okay, it works a little bit different depending on the platform you are using, but we all agree that the GH flavor is the one and only Markdown flavor, don't we? Actually, I'm not sure what's so special about this MD standard, but never mind. The only that counts is, that you know what's it all about.

    description: You said Jira? Isn't this the japanese name for Godzilla? Never mind. I think you're looking for the software. The one software to rule them all. I'm praying for the souls working at Atlassian. I mean this code base must be … big. And actually, I hope for a future where nobody uses Jira. But seems like you're using Jira. Or you work with someone who is using Jira as a project management tool. Or as a wiki. I don't know what you're doing, but I'll include you in my prayers. Good luck converting to this Jira wiki text thing.

Convert to PDF and you can be sure it'll work somehow, even if you the person you're emailing this is 150 years old and has never used a PC before. Good luck with your file!
